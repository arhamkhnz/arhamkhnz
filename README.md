I'm Arham, a **Software Developer** mainly working with 
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=black) & its frameworks.  
JavaScript is my go-to, but I also explore other technologies when needed.

With a thing for design, inspired by clean and functional ideas, I build systems, UIs, and interactions while exploring the creative side of tech.
