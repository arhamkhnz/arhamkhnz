I'm Arham, a **Software Developer** primarily working with 
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=black) & its frameworks.  
I donâ€™t just stick to it though. I explore other technologies too, but JS is my go-to.

Started coding in high school for fun, got stuck with bugs, and never left.  
I focus on writing **simple code to solve big problems**.

A fan of **Minimalism & Brutalist Design**, I build systems, UIs, and interactions, always exploring the creative side of tech.

### My Code in Numbers  
> The code Iâ€™ve written, the mistakes Iâ€™ve fixed, and the things Iâ€™ve built â€” updated weekly.
