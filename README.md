# Hey There <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Hand%20gestures/Love-You%20Gesture.png" alt="Love-You Gesture" width="35" height="35" />

I'm Arham, a **Software Developer** primarily working with 
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=black) & its frameworks.  
I just donâ€™t stick to these â€” I explore other technologies too, but these are my go-to.

Started coding in high school for fun, got stuck with bugs, and never left.  
I write **simple code that solves big problems**.

A fan of **Minimalism & Brutalist Design**, I build systems, UIs, and experiences that stand out, always exploring the creative side of tech.

### My Code in Numbers  
> The code Iâ€™ve written, the mistakes Iâ€™ve fixed, and the things Iâ€™ve built â€” updated weekly.
